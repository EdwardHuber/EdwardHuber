# 🛡️ Edward Huber — Cybersecurity & DFIR Portfolio  
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. This space showcases my hands-on projects, tools, and experiments focused on **digital forensics (DFIR)**, **malware analysis**, and **security awareness training**.  
Whether you're a recruiter, fellow analyst, or just curious — feel free to explore!

## 🔍 About Me  
I’m an **Information Technology major with a Cybersecurity minor** at North Dakota State University, developing tools for **forensic automation, malware simulation, and DFIR workflows**.  

- 🧑‍💻 Python for forensic automation  
- 🧠 DFIR and malware simulation for training  
- 🔐 Registry, memory, and process analysis in safe labs  
- 🎯 Career Goal: Apply my skills in digital forensics and cyber defense within federal service, with a **long-term goal to serve in FBI Cyber Operations**

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach  
Some early projects were developed during **independent summer study** with **AI-assisted coding** used for learning acceleration and debugging.  
All implementations were **independently reviewed, modified, and documented** by me to ensure full understanding of each system.  
This approach accelerated my practical development in **Python, DFIR, and network security**, while maintaining strict **ethical and educational standards**.
